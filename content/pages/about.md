Hello everybody,

My name is Ahmad Mayahi, I was born in 1986 in Iraq, I live and work in Denmark.

Being in love with programming in my whole life, back to 2000 I wrote my first application by using QBasic, then Visual basic and I ended up with Borland Delphi before I switch to web development field.

In 2004 I discovered PHP and since then I use PHP in web projects.

I find PHP to be scalable and easy to use. I have been using it for over ten years to create professional websites.

Additionally, Iâ€™m a certified PHP Engineer from Zend (the PHP company).

Besides PHP, I have a lot of experience with many technologies.

- Linux administration (Ubuntu).
- Git.
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, Memcached.
- Elasticsearch
- NGINX and Apache.
- Docker.
- Amazon Web Services (S3, EC2, RDS, Route53, VPC, etcâ€¦)
- Laravel, Symfony.
- Python, Flask.
- HTML/CSS (of course ðŸ˜€).
- JavaScript.

In this blog, Iâ€™m writing about all these technologies, sometimes youâ€™ll see more focus on some of them, such as PHP and Laravel.

Please feel free to [contact me](https://form.jotform.com/201892949858375), if you have any suggestions/questions.

All my posts are [available on github](https://github.com/ahmadmayahi/mayahi.net/tree/master/content/posts) in markdown format, please feel free to modify/correct any of my posts, I'd appreciate that.

I wrote this blog by using Python 3.8 and Flask 1.1, you may want to [fork](https://github.com/ahmadmayahi/mayahi.net) it on github.
