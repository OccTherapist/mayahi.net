Hello everybody,

My name is Ahmad Mayahi; I was born in 1986 in Iraq; I live and work in Denmark.

I have been in love with programming my whole life; back in 2000, I wrote my first application using QBasic, then Visual basic, and I ended up with Borland Delphi before I switched to the web development field.

In 2004 I discovered PHP, and since then, I have used PHP in web projects.

I find PHP to be scalable and easy to use. I have been using it for over ten years to create professional websites.

Additionally, I'm a [certified PHP Engineer from Zend](https://www.zend-zce.com/en/yellow-pages/ZEND028010) (the PHP company) and [Laravel Certified Developer](https://exam.laravelcert.com/is/ahmad-razoogi-abd-ali/certified-since/2020-12-05?).

Besides PHP, I have a lot of experience with many technologies.

- Laravel.
- NGINX.
- Docker.
- Linux administration (Ubuntu).
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, Memcached.
- Elasticsearch
- Amazon Web Services (S3, EC2, RDS, Route53, VPC, etc.â€¦)
- Git.
- Python, Flask.
- HTML/CSS (of course ðŸ˜€).
- JavaScript.
- Vue.js

In this blog, I'm writing about all these technologies; sometimes, you'll see more focus on some of them, such as PHP and Laravel.

Please feel free to [contact me](https://form.jotform.com/201892949858375), if you have any suggestions/questions.

All my posts are [available on github](https://github.com/ahmadmayahi/mayahi.net/tree/master/content/posts); please feel free to modify/correct any of my posts; I'd appreciate that.

I wrote this blog using Python 3.8 and Flask 1.1; you may want to [fork](https://github.com/ahmadmayahi/mayahi.net) it on Github.

Best,

Ahmad Mayahi
